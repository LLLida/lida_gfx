* Small Vulkan abstraction library

I wrote this library for my own needs. It tries to make writing Vulkan
code not so hard by removing redundant concepts like =descriptor pools=, =descriptor set layouts=, =pipeline layouts=, =framebuffers= etc.

It does so by hiding gruesome Vulkan API code and by using LRU caches to store necessary objects. This library is very lightweight: it's only 2 files, it doesn't have any dependencies except =vulkan/vulkan.h= and it does *NO allocations*.
