* Small Vulkan abstraction library

I wrote this library for my own needs. It tries to make writing Vulkan
code not so hard by removing redundant concepts like =descriptor pools=, =descriptor set layouts=, =pipeline layouts=, =framebuffers= etc.

It does so by hiding gruesome Vulkan API code and by using LRU caches to store necessary objects. This library is very lightweight: it's only 2 files, it doesn't have any dependencies except =vulkan/vulkan.h= and it does *NO allocations*.

* Samples

Check out the [[https://github.com/LLLida/lida_gfx/tree/main/samples][samples]] directory. There are some examples on how to use this library.

** Triangle

Hello world!

[[./images/triangle.png]]

** Cube

 - 2 render passes
 - vertices are loaded to a vertex buffer
 - depth buffer

** Teapots

 - mesh is loaded into a vertex buffer
 - 2 render passes, one with depth buffer
 - a compute pass to do bloom
